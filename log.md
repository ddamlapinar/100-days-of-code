# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: June 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started to learn React and completed the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial on the React JS website.

**Thoughts** : Maybe it is not a good idea to start learning React without having strong knowledge in Vanilla JS but anyway I am coming back most of the time to look up something. Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial was a good overview of React but some concepts didn't fit for me yet. Probably, I'll come back later again.
